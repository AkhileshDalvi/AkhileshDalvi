# Hi there! 👋

## About Me
I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building robust, scalable, and user-centric applications. My journey into coding started in 2020 when I began creating custom indicators for financial markets. Since then, I've transitioned into web development and have had the privilege of working on impactful projects.

Currently, I work as a **Java Full-Stack Developer** at Credit Suisse, where I focus on crafting end-to-end web solutions. I specialize in combining clean, intuitive user interfaces with powerful back-end systems. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Going on rides 🚴‍♂️
- Binge-watching web series 🎬
- Spending quality time with family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Oh, and I also have a Persian kitten named **Marshall** who keeps life interesting! 🐾

## Current Projects
- **Expense Tracker App**: A web application to track daily expenses efficiently.

*(More exciting projects will be added here soon!)*

## Technologies I Work With
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Java
